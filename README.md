## INTRODUCTION

In this project, I have designed a comprehensive Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard using Microsoft Excel and Power Query Editor. 
The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into sales trends, customer footfall, order sizes, product performance, and other key business metrics. 
This dashboard helps in identifying peak hours, customer preferences, and store performance across different locations.
